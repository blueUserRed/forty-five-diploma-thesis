As interest in video games does constantly increase, the video games market continues to grow. This is due to the fact that video games are an entertainment option on the one hand, but they are also a pastime for many people.


The aim of the diploma thesis is to develop a virtual card game that can be downloaded via Steam and played on Windows systems.
The player goes through several runs and fights enemies with the help of playing cards, which they can collect and buy on his way.
The map that is explored is characterized by: Enemies to fight, stores where new Bullets can be purchased and healing events that heal the player.
The aim is to fight all battles and build a deck that can withstand all opponents.


The idea is to get players excited about card games and encourage people to pursue their ideas. It is intended to provide entertainment and combine the Wild West and card game genres.
